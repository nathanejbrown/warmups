# jQuery Selector Practice

This warmup gives you some DOM elements.  There are several buttons that should print out names when they are clicked.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write the jQuery selectors to make the buttons work.

* Go into `js/warmup.js`
* Replace the underscores `___` with real jQuery selectors
* Refresh the web page and click the buttons to see if it works!

The first one has been filled out for you.

# Setup

* Fork
* Clone
* Turn on TravisCI for the fork by
  visiting https://travis-ci.org/profile/<github user name>, clicking the "Sync now" button
  and scrolling down to find the repository to build.
* Create a new branch for your work using `git checkout -b v1`
* Implement specs and code
* Push using `git push -u origin v1`

## Further Practice

This warmup can be completed multiple times to increase your comfort level with the material.
To work on this from scratch, you can:

1. Add an upstream remote that points to the original repo `git remote add upstream git@github.com:gSchool/THIS-REPO.git`
1. Fetch the latest from the upstream remote using `git fetch upstream`
1. Create a new branch from the master branch of the upstream remote `git checkout -b v2 upstream/master`
1. Implement specs and code
1. Push using `git push -u origin v2`

Each time you do the exercise, create a new branch. For example the 3rd time you do the exercise the branch
name will be v3 instead of v2.
